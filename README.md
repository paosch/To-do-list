### User stories
```
As a busy user,
so that I can create a list of all the things I have to do,
I want to be able to add a to-do item.

As a user,
so that I can get organised,
I want to be able to see my to-do list.

As a user,
to feel I have achieved something today,
I want to be able to delete a to-do item from the list.
```
